# 3D Flight Replay — Implementation Notes & Learnings

A WebGL replay of a whole competition task: every pilot's IGC track rendered as
time-animated 3D trajectories, scrubbable, in either an abstract free-orbit view
or draped over a Mapbox satellite/terrain map. Lives at **`/replay`**
(standalone page, no auth; track data comes from the competition-api Worker —
see §8).

This doc captures the architecture, the non-obvious decisions, and the gotchas
that cost real time. It assumes the original engineering brief (the spec the
viewer was built from) as background.

---

## 1. What was built

- A page `/replay` showing all ~32 pilots of Corryong Cup 2026 Task 1
  with synchronized playback, pilot identity, altitude/vario colouring, task
  geometry, gaggle detection, and a selectable backdrop (abstract vs Mapbox
  terrain).
- **Per-pilot live metrics** (see §5.15): rank badges pinned to the marker
  cones, and a draggable metrics callout (altitude / climb / ground speed /
  glide ratio) with a leader line to the pilot's cone. There is deliberately
  **no tooltip window next to the pilot** — hovering a cone routes that
  pilot's metrics into the callout as a live preview; clicking the cone pins
  (follows) them. Clicking/tapping away from every cone toggles play/pause
  (as does the spacebar), so the whole canvas is the play button.
- The packing logic is **pure and fs/DOM-free** (`packTracksFromIgc` in the
  engine), so the *same* code runs in two places:
  - **Runtime, Worker-served (primary):** `GET /api/comp/:comp_id/task/:task_id/3dvis`
    (and `GET /api/comp/sample-3dvis` for the public sample) reads each pilot's
    IGC from R2, packs, and returns one binary **bundle** — `[uint32 manifestLen]
    [manifest JSON][gzipped Float32 data]` — cached in KV. This is what the page
    loads (`viewer.loadBundle`).
  - **Build-time mirror (offline):** the `build-3dvis` CLI writes the same
    manifest + `tracks.bin.gz` to `web/frontend/public/replay-offline/` for
    offline inspection/regression. No longer on the page's hot path.
- The sample is a **real competition in the database** (comp + task + pilots +
  IGC in R2), so every user can view it; see *Sample competition* below.

### Run / regenerate

```bash
bun run dev                   # workers + frontend; http://localhost:3000/replay
bun run seed:sample           # load the sample comp into local D1 + R2 (idempotent)
bun run seed:sample --remote  # …or into production D1 + R2
bun run build-3dvis           # offline: regenerate the static asset mirror
```

The page calls `/api/comp/sample-3dvis` by default; `?comp=<id>&task=<id>` points
the same viewer at any competition task the user may view.

## 2. Architecture

Three stages, kept cleanly separated (per the brief):

### Files

Engine (pure, no DOM — runs in both the Worker and the CLI):
- `web/engine/src/track-packer.ts` — pure `packTracks()`: project, time-align,
  pack the binary + manifest, palette, task geometry. Exported from `index.ts`.
- `web/engine/src/track-pack-pipeline.ts` — `packTracksFromIgc()`: parse IGC →
  GAP score → `packTracks`. Shared by the Worker and the CLI.
- `web/engine/cli/build-3dvis.ts` — offline mirror: reads IGC + task, resolves
  the timezone (geo-tz), gzips, writes the static asset.

Worker (`web/workers/competition-api/src/`):
- `visualization.ts` (`buildTask3dvisBundle`) + `routes/visualization.ts` — the
  runtime path the page actually loads (see §8).

Frontend (`web/frontend/src/replay.html` + `web/frontend/src/replay/`):
- `track-data.ts` — `loadTracksBundle` (one Worker fetch) / `loadTracks`
  (two-file mirror) + `DecompressionStream("gzip")` → typed arrays;
  per-vertex `aPilot`/`aVario`; `samplePilot()` binary-search + lerp.
- `flight-scene.ts` — the backend-agnostic Three content + custom shaders.
- `backend.ts` — the `Backend` interface.
- `abstract-backend.ts` / `terrain-backend.ts` — the two implementations.
- `replay-viewer.ts` — orchestrator (owns view state, drives the loop).
- `map-styles.ts` — Mapbox style list (no mapbox-gl import → stays out of the
  initial bundle).
- `replay.html` / `replay/main.ts` — page chrome + wiring.

`mapbox-gl` is **lazy-imported** by `terrain-backend.ts` only, so it's a separate
~508 KB-gzip chunk fetched only when the user picks the map backdrop; the initial
`3dvis` chunk is Three-only (~142 KB gzip).

---

## 3. The binary format

`manifest.json` (tiny): origin (`lat0/lon0/alt0`), `mPerDegLat/Lon`, `t0/t1`,
`altMin/altMax`, `colors` palette, `timezone`, and `pilots[]` with
`{id, name, colorIdx, vertexOffset, vertexCount, rank, score}` plus optional
`task.turnpoints[]` (projected `x/z`, radius, type, name).

`tracks.bin.gz`: gzip of one interleaved `Float32Array`, **4 floats per vertex**
`[x, y, z, tRel]`, pilots concatenated in `pilots[]` order. Per-vertex pilot
index, colour and vario are **derived at load** (not stored) to keep it minimal
(~4.6 MB raw → ~3.0 MB gzipped for 287k vertices).

Loaded via `res.body.pipeThrough(new DecompressionStream("gzip"))` straight into
a `Float32Array` — no unzip library. (Has a fallback for servers that
transparently gunzip.)

---

## 4. Key decisions

- **Raw Three.js, no R3F.** One merged `LineSegments` + a custom `ShaderMaterial`
  animated by a single `uTime` uniform (comet-tail fade + future-discard per
  vertex). Scrubbing is `uniforms.uTime.value = t` — zero CPU per frame.
- **Markers** are an `InstancedMesh` of cones, CPU-lerped each frame and oriented
  along velocity.
- **Altitude source:** GPS (the airScore-generated IGC files have pressure alt =
  0). `alt0` = min altitude, so the scene floor sits at y=0.
- **Origin:** mean of pilots' first fixes (takeoffs).
- **Scoring ranks** are computed at build time via the engine's `scoreTask()` and
  baked into the manifest; the legend sorts by rank, showing each pilot's rank
  chip (same badge as their cone in the scene) + score. Matches the published
  AirScore order at the top.
- **Pilot colours hash the name** (`colorForName` in `track-packer.ts`), not the
  roster index, so a pilot keeps the same colour across rebuilds even if the
  field changes. FNV-1a → hue, reusing `buildPalette`'s saturation/lightness
  bands so it stays visually consistent. Trade-off: hashing can occasionally put
  two pilots on near-identical hues (the golden-angle palette guaranteed maximal
  separation) — name-stability was judged worth it. Re-run `bun run build-3dvis`
  to regenerate the manifest after touching the colour logic.

## 5. Gotchas & learnings (the expensive ones)

### 5.1 Coordinate handedness — use North = −Z

The single biggest bug. Projecting with **North = +Z** in a right-handed Y-up
Three scene is a *left-handed geographic* frame: a plain camera facing north
renders **East on the LEFT** — the whole abstract scene is mirrored E–W. It hid
for a long time because trails and cones are symmetric, and the Mapbox backend's
model matrix happened to compensate; the tell was turnpoint *positions* (ELLIOT
is east of CUDG in reality).

**Fix:** geographically-correct right-handed ENU in the packer:
`x = (lon−lon0)·mPerDegLon` (East = +X), `z = (lat0−lat)·mPerDegLat`
(**North = −Z**), `y = alt−alt0` (Up = +Y). Then a north-facing camera shows
East on the right.

The brief explicitly warned about this ("North ends up pointing toward the
default camera; flip the sign of z … the #1 source of 'why is everything
mirrored' confusion"). Believe it. **Verify E/W against the satellite map, not
against symmetric trails.**

### 5.2 Mapbox container collapses to 0 height

Mapbox adds the class `.mapboxgl-map { position: relative }` to its container,
which **overrides a Tailwind `absolute`**. With `position: relative`, `inset-0`
no longer resolves a height → the container collapses to 0 → the map renders
**solid black** (the abstract Three canvas was immune because it sets its own
pixel size). Fix: give the map container an explicit `h-full w-full`, never rely
on `absolute inset-0` for a Mapbox container.

### 5.3 Hosting Three in a raw Mapbox custom layer (no Threebox)

A raw `{ type: 'custom', renderingMode: '3d' }` layer reuses our `uTime`
ShaderMaterial verbatim (Threebox would fight it). The bridge: in `render(gl,
matrix)`, set `camera.projectionMatrix = mapboxMatrix · modelMatrix`, where the
model matrix maps local ENU metres → mercator:

```
mercator.x = originMerc.x + xE · s
mercator.y = originMerc.y + zS · s     (local +Z is south; mercator Y is south)
mercator.z = alt0·vScale·s + yUp · s
```

with `s = originMerc.meterInMercatorCoordinateUnits()`. Notes:
- With North = −Z this model matrix is a **reflection (det < 0)** — but it
  **cancels Mapbox's own north-up mercator flip**, so the visible chirality
  matches the abstract backend. Net result: positions correct in both, and text
  labels need **no per-backend flip**.
- mapbox-gl v3.25 custom-layer render signature is still `(gl, matrix:number[])`
  for mercator; `map.redraw()` does **not** exist (use the internal `_render(0)`
  if you must force a synchronous frame).
- Anchoring `originMerc` at `alt0` reconstructs true MSL automatically, so the
  same asset works for both backends with **no absolute-altitude regen**.
- `setStyle()` wipes all sources/layers (DEM, sky, custom layer) and the
  `style.load` handler must re-add them every time; only frame the camera on the
  first load so style switches keep the view. Reuse the `WebGLRenderer` across
  switches (the GL context persists). Switching raster↔vector styles logs a
  benign `"style diff … Rebuilding"` warning.

### 5.4 InstancedMesh per-instance colour → do NOT set `vertexColors: true`

Use a plain `MeshBasicMaterial()` + `mesh.setColorAt(i, c)`; the renderer applies
`instanceColor` itself. Setting `vertexColors: true` makes the shader multiply by
the geometry's `color` attribute, which a `ConeGeometry` doesn't have → it
defaults to (0,0,0) and **every instance renders black**.

### 5.5 `scene.fog` darkens lit materials but not ShaderMaterials

Fog faded the (Lambert) marker cones to near-black at competition-scale distances
while the (ShaderMaterial) trails stayed bright. Dropped the fog and made markers
unlit `MeshBasicMaterial` (reads pure pilot colour from any angle anyway).

### 5.6 `gl.LINES` width is capped at 1px

`linewidth` is ignored on most platforms. To make trail width adjustable, render
the fixes **additionally as round `Points`** sized by a `uWidth` uniform
(`gl_PointSize`), layered over the thin connecting line (the line fills gaps when
zoomed in; the points give thickness; overlapping round dots merge into a smooth
thick ribbon). The points reuse the trail vertex shader and **share its uniforms
object**, so time-fade/colour/visibility/highlight all apply for free. (The
brief's "v2" alternative is `Line2`/`LineMaterial`, a bigger rewrite.)

### 5.7 Ground text labels — orientation is fiddly

Turnpoint names are canvas-texture planes laid flat (`rotation.x = −π/2`) with a
fixed orientation (North up, reading W→E), so they're upright facing north and
upside-down from the south (not billboards). After the North = −Z fix both
backends share chirality, so **no per-backend flip is needed** (an earlier
version needed one — that was a symptom of the handedness bug). When verifying
text orientation, symmetric glyphs (E/I/O) hide flips — **check L and T**, and
read on the high-contrast Dark map style zoomed in.

### 5.8 Vertical exaggeration applied per-object (on purpose)

Not a single group scale. Trails: `uVScale` in the vertex shader; markers:
`y *= vScale` in JS (keeps the cone shape); cylinder walls: `scale.y`. This keeps
every host transform **uniform**, so neither backend has to deal with a
non-uniform scale (which would shear the marker cones). Mapbox terrain
exaggeration is kept equal to `vScale`.

### 5.9 Local time — geo-tz at build time

IGC fixes are UTC and the comp's timezone isn't in the data. Resolve the IANA
zone from the task origin with **`geo-tz`** at build time (offline; added as an
engine *devDependency* so it never reaches the browser/Worker bundle) and store
`manifest.timezone` (e.g. `Australia/Melbourne`). The viewer formats with
`Intl`, which applies the correct DST offset per fix date. Compute the zone
*label* at the comp date, not today's, or the abbreviation is off by an hour
across a DST boundary. (For runtime lookups in a Worker, `@photostructure/tz-lookup`
is small enough to bundle; prebaking is better whenever there's a build step.)

### 5.10 Headless preview can't screenshot Mapbox — use Playwright

The `preview_*` harness reports a `0×0` viewport, suspends `requestAnimationFrame`
(so Mapbox never auto-paints), and Mapbox's canvas is `preserveDrawingBuffer:false`.
Result: Mapbox screenshots as black even when it works. **`_render(0)` + `gl.readPixels`
gives FALSE POSITIVES** (it reads the off-screen backbuffer, not the composited
canvas — it once "confirmed" a black map as working). Verify Mapbox with the
Playwright MCP (`browser_navigate` + `browser_take_screenshot`): real viewport,
live rAF. The abstract Three view does screenshot fine in the preview harness.

Also: suspended rAF in a hidden tab means a backgrounded-then-resumed tab gets a
huge first `dt` → clamp `dt` in the playback loop (`Math.min(dt, 0.1)`).

### 5.11 Matching OrbitControls mouse/touch to Mapbox — don't fight the built-in swap

We want both backdrops to feel identical: **drag pans, Ctrl/⌘+drag orbits**
(Mapbox's default), and Shift+drag (Mapbox box-zoom) does nothing here. Three
non-obvious facts made this a multi-attempt fix:

- **OrbitControls already swaps PAN↔ROTATE while a modifier is held.** When the
  resolved mouse action is `ROTATE` *and* `ctrlKey/metaKey/shiftKey` is down, it
  deliberately switches to PAN (and `PAN`+modifier → ROTATE). So forcing
  `mouseButtons.LEFT = ROTATE` on Ctrl is *wrong* — OrbitControls swaps it right
  back to PAN and you never orbit. **Fix:** set both `LEFT` and `RIGHT` to `PAN`
  and let the built-in swap produce the orbit. No per-event remapping.
- **macOS delivers Ctrl+click as a right-click** (`button === 2`). That's why
  `RIGHT` must also be `PAN` — otherwise Ctrl+drag on a Mac lands on the RIGHT
  slot and the swap never runs. (This burned a whole "it doesn't orbit at all"
  round; the user was on a Mac.)
- **Swallowing Shift+drag needs a capture listener on the canvas's _parent_.**
  A capture listener on the canvas itself does **not** beat OrbitControls: when
  the canvas is the event target, all its listeners fire in registration order
  (capture flag ignored), and OrbitControls registered first. Listen on the
  parent in the capture phase and `stopPropagation()` before the event ever
  descends to the canvas.
- Touch: `touches.ONE = PAN`, `touches.TWO = DOLLY_ROTATE` to mirror Mapbox
  (one finger pans, two fingers orbit + pinch-zoom).

Verify with Playwright `browser_run_code_unsafe` driving real `page.mouse` +
`page.keyboard` with modifiers; assert on `controls.getAzimuthalAngle()` /
`getPolarAngle()` (expose `controls` on `window` under `import.meta.env.DEV`).
Comparing the compass transform *string* is too noisy — parse the bearing number.

### 5.12 Free-look follow — track the pilot's delta, don't snap onto it

The first follow implementation set `controls.target = pilot` every frame, which
fights the user: any pan is overwritten next frame. The wanted behaviour is
"keep the pilot wherever it is on screen when the follow starts (or after I
pan/orbit)". Implementation: on the first follow frame **anchor** the pilot's
position without moving the camera; each later frame shift **both** `target` and
`camera.position` by the pilot's movement since the last frame
(`sample.pos − lastPos`). The camera↔target offset is never touched, so
pan/orbit/zoom all persist and the pilot stays pinned. Re-anchor (don't apply a
delta) when the followed pilot changes or goes inactive, to avoid a jump. Same
idea on terrain: `map.setCenter(center + pilotDelta)` reading the live centre
first so user drag survives. (Verified: pure follow pins the pilot to the exact
pixel; only transient OrbitControls damping causes a few px of settle after an
orbit/pan.)

### 5.13 Orientation presets (compass / top / side) — drive OrbitControls via Spherical

Compass-click = north-up, plus Top/Side buttons. There's no `setAzimuthalAngle`
on OrbitControls, so tween in `render()`: read the current camera→target offset
into a `THREE.Spherical`, lerp `theta`/`phi` (ease-in-out cubic) keeping
`radius`, then `camera.position = target + offset.setFromSpherical(s)`. **θ = 0
is north-up** (camera due south of target, looking north) — matches
`getBearingDeg`'s `atan2(dir.x, −dir.z)`. Top = `phi ≈ 0.02`, Side =
`phi = maxPolarAngle`. This coexists with damping (`controls.update()` recomputes
its spherical from the position we set, with zero user input) and with follow
(the tween sets position relative to the follow-shifted target). These presets
deliberately **keep** the active follow; only Reset clears it. Terrain uses
`map.easeTo({ bearing/pitch })`.

### 5.14 Optimised task line — pre-project at build time, not runtime

The viewer draws the same optimised (shortest) task line as the 2D analysis map.
`calculateOptimizedTaskLine(task)` returns **lat/lon** tagging each cylinder
edge, but the runtime has no lat/lon task (only the ENU manifest), so we run the
optimiser in `packTracks()` and store the result pre-projected into ENU as
`manifest.task.optimizedPath: {x,z}[]` (same `projX/projZ` as the turnpoints).
`FlightScene.buildOptimizedPath()` then draws it as a flat `#6366f1` dashed
`LineDashedMaterial` (call `computeLineDistances()` or the dash pattern is
inert), with flat indigo arrowheads at each leg midpoint rotated by
`rotation.y = −atan2(dz, dx)` to show course direction (legs shorter than the
arrow are skipped). It lives in the shared `FlightScene.group`, so both backends
get it for free; `depthTest: false` keeps it over the terrain like the rings.
**The line starts at the takeoff centre, not an edge**, when turnpoint 0 is a
`TAKEOFF` — FAI treats a takeoff as a fixed point (`firstTurnpointRadius` → 0),
and this matches the 2D analysis map exactly. Don't "fix" it to start at the
SSS edge; it's intentional and rule-correct.

### 5.15 Per-pilot metrics overlays — DOM, not in-scene sprites

Rank badges on the cones and the follow callout are **DOM elements positioned
from `projectToScreen` every frame**, not THREE.Sprites. Reasons:

- The terrain backend bakes the whole view into `camera.projectionMatrix`
  (mercator bridge, §5.3), so sprite billboarding — which reads the
  model-view matrix — mis-orients there. DOM overlays sidestep this entirely
  and behave identically on both backends.
- DOM text is crisp at any zoom, styleable with Tailwind, and free to layer
  (z-index) against the other chrome.

The viewer emits a per-frame `onFrame(samples: PilotScreenSample[])` callback
with every pilot's projected screen position + live metrics; the array is
**reused across frames** (no allocation). Picking (`pickAt`) shares those same
projections. Click-vs-drag on the canvas is discriminated by pointer travel
(≤5 px = click; primary pointer only, so multi-touch gestures never count).
A click on a cone follows that pilot; a background click toggles play/pause
(suppressed when it's dismissing the open control drawer), as does Space
(unless a form control has focus).

**Ground speed and climb are averaged over a fixed window** in `samplePilot`
(`METRIC_AVG_SECONDS` = 20 s of flight time, independent of playback speed —
the readout is labelled "(20s avg)"). The jitter this fixes is *not* sensor
noise: at 16× the display replays the pilot's genuine within-thermal-circle
oscillation (climb really does swing −3 → +1 around each ~20 s circle, i.e.
flicker at ~0.7 Hz on screen). A fixed window was chosen over scaling with
playback speed deliberately: a "20 s average climb" means the same thing at
1× and 240×, which is what you want for judging how well a thermal is going.
Speed is the horizontal *path length* over the window — a straight-line
delta reads near zero while circling. Glide ratio is derived as
`speed / -climb`, shown as `∞` when level/climbing and capped (>40 → `∞`).
On top of that the callout digits repaint at most ~1×/s during playback
(live when paused or on pilot change); altitude stays per-frame (it's steady
by nature).

**The climb readout is a vario gauge, not just digits**: a half-dial
(−4…+4 m/s) whose needle shows the *near-instantaneous* climb (fixed ±3-fix
window, `climbInst`) at full frame rate — flicker is intentional — drawn over
a phosphor trail of its last ~3 s of positions fading like a radium dial, so
the flicker's spread reads as a glowing variance band while the digit beneath
stays averaged. Implementation note: the trail is a ring buffer of needle
angles redrawn from scratch each frame; do NOT fade with
`destination-out` fills — 8-bit alpha rounding leaves permanently stuck ghost
pixels at low alpha. The trail resets on pilot switch.

The callout is draggable (pointer capture on the bubble, clamped to the
viewport, position persisted in `localStorage`), with an SVG leader line that
exits the bubble's nearest edge and ends in a dot on the pilot's cone —
hidden when the cone is off-screen or under the bubble.

The callout is the **single metrics surface**: hovering any cone shows that
pilot in it (a live preview — no floating tooltip beside the pilot, so the
racing stays unobscured), and clicking pins the followed pilot. The ✕ (stop
following) is hidden during hover-only previews. The old `#tooltip` element
remains only for the gaggle-ribbon hovers (GaggleUI).

## 6. Performance notes

- ~287k vertices, one merged `LineSegments` draw call — trivial for the GPU
  (fill-rate bound from overdraw, not vertex bound).
- The per-frame cost is just ~32 marker lerps + uniform updates. Keep the rAF
  loop allocation-free: reuse a single `MarkerSample[]` and scratch `Vector3`s,
  cache the mercator model matrix (rebuild only on `vScale` change), and don't
  project the hovered marker twice.
- Pilot picking is screen-space nearest-marker (project all markers, pick within
  ~20px) — no raycasting/GPU-picking needed at this scale.

---

## 7. Possible follow-ups

- **Thick presentational strokes** via `Line2`/`LineMaterial` (true pixel width,
  no point-bead artefacts) — would need the `uTime` clipping ported into
  `LineMaterial`'s shader, or one draw call per pilot.
- **Vario as a 5th packed float** instead of deriving it at load (the brief's
  option) — currently smoothed in `track-data.ts`.
- **Task geometry depth** — turnpoint rings sit at `alt0`, not draped on the DEM;
  could query terrain elevation per turnpoint.
- ~~**Worker preprocessing**~~ — *done*: the packer runs in the competition-api
  Worker at request time (KV-cached), serving a single bundle; see *Sample
  competition* below.
- **Follow-cam smoothing**, colour-by leader-gap, airspace volumes.

---

## 8. Sample competition (Worker-served data)

The replay is fed by a **real competition in the database** rather than a static
file, so any user can view it and the same path serves any comp task.

- **Source:** `web/samples/comps/corryong-cup-2026-open-t1/` (33 IGC + `task.xctsk`)
  — the first task of the bundled Corryong Cup 2026 comp; `sample-3dvis` serves
  the earliest task by date. See the CLAUDE.md "Updating bundled data" notes for
  the full open/floater multi-class layout.
- **Seed:** `bun run seed:sample` (`--remote` for production). Idempotent — the
  comp is found by name (`SAMPLE_COMP_NAME`, shared in
  `web/workers/competition-api/src/sample.ts`); reruns wipe that comp's tasks /
  pilots / tracks (D1) and IGC objects (R2) and rebuild under the **same
  comp_id**, so a messed-with sample is fixed back up. It's a public comp
  (`test = 0`), single class `open`, scored together for legend order.
- **Endpoint:** `web/workers/competition-api/src/visualization.ts`
  (`buildTask3dvisBundle`) + `routes/visualization.ts`. Mirrors `scoring.ts`:
  fetch `task_track` rows → R2 `get` → gunzip → `packTracksFromIgc` → gzip data
  → frame the bundle → cache in KV (`3dvis:v1:<taskId>:<hash>`, invalidated by
  the same task-state hash as scores).
- **Timezone:** `geo-tz` is node-only, so the seed resolves it and stashes it as
  `_timezone` inside the stored task xctsk JSON; the Worker reads it back and
  puts it on the manifest (`parseXCTask` ignores the extra key). Without it the
  viewer falls back to the browser zone.
- **Frontend:** `loadTracksBundle` in `track-data.ts` (one fetch, split manifest
  from gzipped data) → `ReplayViewer.loadBundle`. `replay/main.ts` builds the URL.
- **Entry points:** the homepage links to the replay (`/replay`, no
  params → `sample-3dvis`). Every competition **task page** (`comp-detail.ts`)
  and the **score page** (`scores.ts`) link to `/replay?comp=<id>&task=<id>`
  for their real tasks — the in-app path needs no `sample-3dvis` (the page knows
  the ids). The task-page link appears once the task has scoreable tracks.

## 8. Conventions to keep

- Local ENU frame: **X = East, Y = Up, Z = South (North = −Z)**, right-handed.
- `mapbox-gl` stays lazy-imported (terrain-backend only); keep style/data lists
  in dependency-free modules so they don't drag the chunk into the initial load.
- Verify map/geography changes in a real browser (Playwright), and check E/W
  against the satellite imagery.
