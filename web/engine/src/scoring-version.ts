/**
 * Version of the scoring engine's observable behaviour.
 *
 * The competition API folds this into every scoring cache key (task scores,
 * comp standings, per-track analysis, per-pilot transparency), so results
 * computed by two different engine generations can never be served side by
 * side: a deploy that changes scoring behaviour rolls every key at once.
 * Because the engine is deterministic, a cached score and a cached analysis
 * under the same version + inputs are guaranteed to agree — this is what
 * lets the score-details page present the narrative as exact, with no
 * "may not match the published score" hedging.
 *
 * Bump this whenever scoring behaviour changes. You cannot forget: the
 * scoring-version fingerprint test hashes every scoring-relevant source
 * file and fails the build when they change without a bump here. After a
 * bump, update SCORING_SOURCE_FINGERPRINT to the hash the test prints.
